# BAMAZON
## This app will prompt the user on what they would like to purchase from the store. Once a purchase has been made, the in stock quantities will update accordingly. If the store does not have enough to fulfill the user's order, the order will not be placed. 

# Instructions (Once files are cloned onto the local machine with node installed).
1. ## Open bamazoncustomer.js in the terminal and run the following commands to install the packages.

    >npm install mysql

    >npm install inquirer


1. ## After the required packages are installed, copy everything from the bamazon.sql file, paste it into MySQLWorkbench, and execute the code to create the database.
